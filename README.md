## Introduction

For the project on hate speech identification in the context of the EE-559 Deep Learning course, we aim to create a neural network-based model specialized in identifying religious discrimination. We plan to build our model upon a pre-trained BERT architecture, as introduced in class, and fine-tune it using the datasets listed below. The model will then be used to assess the presence of religious discrimination in YouTube's comment section. The final part of the report will discuss the results.
