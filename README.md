## Introduction

For the project concerning hate speech identification in the context of the ee-559 Deep Learning course, we aim to create a neural network based model specalized in identifying religious dsicrimination. We wish to build our model upon an existing BERT model as seen in class on the datasets listed below. We will use this model to assess the presence of religious discrimination within Youtube's comment section. The last part of the report will discuss teh results.
